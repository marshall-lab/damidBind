  abstract = {During development eukaryotic gene expression is coordinated by dynamic changes in chromatin structure. Measurements of accessible chromatin are used extensively to identify genomic regulatory elements. Whilst chromatin landscapes of pluripotent stem cells are well characterised, chromatin accessibility changes in the development of somatic lineages are not well defined. Here we show that cell-specific chromatin accessibility data can be produced via ectopic expression of E. coli Dam methylase in vivo, without the requirement for cell-sorting (CATaDa). We have profiled chromatin accessibility in individual cell-types of Drosophila neural and midgut lineages. Functional cell-type-specific enhancers were identified, as well as novel motifs enriched at different stages of development. Finally, we show global changes in the accessibility of chromatin between stem-cells and their differentiated progeny. Our results demonstrate the dynamic nature of chromatin accessibility in somatic tissues during stem cell differentiation and provide a novel approach to understanding gene regulatory mechanisms underlying development.For an embryo to successfully develop into an adult animal, specific genes must act in different types of cells. Though all the cells have the same genes encoded within their DNA, looking at the way that the DNA is packaged can indicate which parts of the DNA are important for that particular cell type. If regions of DNA are ``open'' one can infer that those regions are actively involved in gene regulation, whereas ``closed'' regions are considered less important.It is currently difficult to determine which parts of the DNA are open within an individual cell type in a complex organ, such as the brain. Existing methods require the cells to be physically isolated from the tissue, which is technically challenging.To overcome this issue, Aughey et al. have now developed a method that does not require isolation of the cells. The new technique involves using genetic engineering to introduce an enzyme called Dam into specific cell types in living fruit flies. This enzyme adds a chemical label on regions of open DNA, which can then be detected. Aughey et al. tested this technique on various cells of the developing brain and gut, and were able to see differences in the openness of DNA that corresponded to the action of genes that are important in each cell type. The data also contain trends that help to understand the role of open DNA in development. For example, mature cells were shown to overall have less open DNA than the stem cells that divide to generate them.Aughey et al. hope their new technique will be of use to other researchers working with either fruit flies or mammalian tissues. The knowledge that scientists will gain from identifying how open DNA contributes to gene regulation, in both healthy and diseased tissues, will further our understanding of human development and the biology of diseases such as cancer.},

  abstract = {UNLABELLED DamID is a powerful technique for identifying regions of the genome bound by a DNA-binding (or DNA-associated) protein. Currently, no method exists for automatically processing next-generation sequencing DamID (DamID-seq) data, and the use of DamID-seq datasets with normalization based on read-counts alone can lead to high background and the loss of bound signal. DamID-seq thus presents novel challenges in terms of normalization and background minimization. We describe here damidseq\_pipeline, a software pipeline that performs automatic normalization and background reduction on multiple DamID-seq FASTQ datasets. AVAILABILITY AND IMPLEMENTATION Open-source and freely available from http://owenjm.github.io/damidseq\_pipeline. The damidseq\_pipeline is implemented in Perl and is compatible with any Unix-based operating system (e.g. Linux, Mac OSX).

  abstract = {Cell-type-specific transcriptional profiling often requires the isolation of specific cell types from complex tissues. We have developed "TaDa," a technique that enables cell-specific profiling without cell isolation. TaDa permits genome-wide profiling of DNA- or chromatin-binding proteins without cell sorting, fixation, or affinity purification. The method is simple, sensitive, highly reproducible, and transferable to any model system. We show that TaDa can be used to identify transcribed genes in a cell-type-specific manner with considerable temporal precision, enabling the identification of differential gene expression between neuroblasts and the neuroepithelial cells from which they derive. We profile the genome-wide binding of RNA polymerase II in these adjacent, clonally related stem cells within intact Drosophila brains. Our data reveal expression of specific metabolic genes in neuroepithelial cells, but not in neuroblasts, and highlight gene regulatory networks that may pattern neural stem cell fates.},

  abstract = {We have developed a novel technique, named DamID, for the identification of DNA loci that interact in vivo with specific nuclear proteins in eukaryotes. By tethering Escherichia coli DNA adenine methyltransferase (Dam) to a chromatin protein, Dam can be targeted in vivo to native binding sites of this protein, resulting in local DNA methylation. Sites of methylation can subsequently be mapped using methylation-specific restriction enzymes or antibodies. We demonstrate the successful application of DamID both in Drosophila cell cultures and in whole flies. When Dam is tethered to the DNA-binding domain of GAL4, targeted methylation is limited to a region of a few kilobases surrounding a GAL4 binding sequence. Using DamID, we identified a number of expected and unexpected target loci for Drosophila heterochromatin protein 1. DamID has potential for genome-wide mapping of in vivo targets of chromatin proteins in various eukaryotes.},

  abstract = {Chromatin is the highly complex structure consisting of DNA and hundreds of associated proteins. Most chromatin proteins exert their regulatory and structural functions by binding to specific chromosomal loci. Knowledge of the identity of these in vivo target loci is essential for the understanding of the functions and mechanisms of action of chromatin proteins. We report here large-scale mapping of in vivo binding sites of chromatin proteins, using a novel approach based on a combination of targeted DNA methylation and microarray technology. We show that three distinct chromatin proteins in Drosophila melanogaster cells each associate with specific sets of genes. HP1 binds predominantly to pericentric genes and transposable elements. GAGA factor associates with euchromatic genes that are enriched in (GA)n motifs. A Drosophila homolog of Saccharomyces cerevisiae Sir2p is associated with several active genes and is excluded from heterochromatin. High-resolution, genome-wide maps of target loci of chromatin proteins ('chromatin profiles') provide new insights into chromatin structure and gene regulation.},

  abstract = {Notch signaling is an evolutionarily conserved pathway for specifying binary neuronal fates, yet how it specifies different fates in different contexts remains elusive. In our accompanying paper, using the Drosophila lamina neuron types (L1-L5) as a model, we show that the primary homeodomain transcription factor (HDTF) Bsh activates secondary HDTFs Ap (L4) and Pdm3 (L5) and specifies L4/L5 neuronal fates. Here we test the hypothesis that Notch signaling enables Bsh to differentially specify L4 and L5 fates. We show asymmetric Notch signaling between newborn L4 and L5 neurons, but they are not siblings; rather, Notch signaling in L4 is due to Delta expression in adjacent L1 neurons. While Notch signaling and Bsh expression are mutually independent, Notch is necessary and sufficient for Bsh to specify L4 fate over L5. The NotchON L4, compared to NotchOFF L5, has a distinct open chromatin landscape which allows Bsh to bind distinct genomic loci, leading to L4-specific identity gene transcription. We propose a novel model in which Notch signaling is integrated with the primary HDTF activity to diversify neuron types by directly or indirectly generating a distinct open chromatin landscape that constrains the pool of genes that a primary HDTF can activate.},
