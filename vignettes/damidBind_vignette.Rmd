  The damidBind package provides a means of determining differential binding/gene transcription/chromatin accessibility for DamID-seq data (differential binding = conventional DamID / TaDa for TFs; differential transcription = TaDa for RNA polymerase occupancy; chromatin accessibility = CATaDa).  The package loads processed bedgraphs and peaks files, processes these, uses limma (for DamID log2 ratios) or NOIseq (for CATaDa counts data) to determine differentially bound/transcribed/accessible loci, and then provides visualisation via volcano plots, GSEA lollipop plots, Venn diagrams, and an igvShiny interface to quickly view each differentially bound locus in an IGV browser, with the ranked, sorted differentially bound loci listed in an adjacent interactable table.

# Introduction

DamID [@Steensel2000; @Steensel2001] is a highly-sensitive means to profile the genome-wide association of proteins with chromatin in living eukaryotic cells, without fixation or the use of antibodies. Cell-type specific techniques such as Targeted DamID [@Southall2013; @Marshall2016] to profile protein binding, and CATaDA [@Aughey2018] to profile chromatin accessibility, have made the technique an extremely powerful tool to understand the binding of transcription factors, chromatin proteins, RNA polymerase and chromatin changes during development and disease.

Despite the technique's growing popularity and adoption, no formal analysis pipeline or R package exists to analyse and explore differential DamID binding, gene transcription or chromatin accessibility between two conditions. The `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` package provides this functionality.

`r Biocpkg('damidBind')` imports processed data from DamID-seq experiments in the form of binding bedgraphs and GFF peak calls. After optionally normalising data, combining peaks across replicates and determining per-replicate peak occupancy, the package links bound loci to nearby genes. It then uses either `r Biocpkg("limma")` (for conventional log2 ratio DamID binding data) or `r Biocpkg("NOIseq")` (for counts-based CATaDa chromatin accessibility data) to identify differentially-enriched regions between two conditions. The package provides a number of visualisation tools (volcano plots, GSEA plots, Venn diagrams) for downstream data exploration and analysis. An interactive IGV genome browser interface (powered by `r CRANpkg("Shiny")` and `r Biocpkg("igvShiny")`) allows users to rapidly and intuitively assess significant differentially-bound regions.

Although extensive customisation options are available if required, much of the data handling by `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` is taken care of automatically, with sensible defaults assumed. To move from loading raw data to visualising differentially-enriched regions on a volcano plot or browsing enriched regions in an interactive IGV window is a simple three command procedure.

# Quick start guide

Using `r Biocpkg('damidBind')`, in eight easy steps:

```{r quickstart, eval=FALSE, echo=TRUE}
## Example code only, not run:

input <- load_data_peaks(
    binding_profiles_path = "path/to/binding_profile_bedgraphs",
    peaks_path = "path/to/peak_gffs_or_beds"
) # add quantile_norm = TRUE if appropriate

my_custom_function(analysisTable(input.diff))
```


# Sample data examples

## Sample input data (provided within the package)

`r Biocpkg('damidBind')` provides a simple, truncated dataset with the package for immediate testing. Owing to package space, this sample dataset uses only *Drosophila melanogaster* chromosome 2L binding, and should not be used for any actual analysis.

## Sample input data (provided online through a Zenodo repository)

[Three previously-published sample datasets](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.16649477) have been deposited in Zenodo and made available for fully exploring the features and capabilities of `r Biocpkg('damidBind')`:

-   Bsh transcription factor binding in L4 and L5 neurons of the *Drosophila* lamina [@Xu2024]
-   CATaDa chromatin accessibility data in L4 and L5 neurons [@Xu2024]
-   RNA Polymerase II occupancy in *Drosophila* larval neural stem cells and adult neurons. [@Marshall2017]

Processed files (incl. binding profiles and peaks files) are provided for all datasets.

# Data preparation

## Input data format

`r Biocpkg('damidBind')` takes as input:

-   Genome-wide binding profile tracks in BEDGRAPH format (external files) or `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")` format (internal)
    -   For standard DamID binding datasets, the score column is expected to be a log2 ratio
    -   For CATaDa chromatin accessibility datasets, the score column should be in CPM (counts per million reads) or similar
-   Significant peaks files in GFF or BED format (external files) or `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")` format (internal)
    -   Peaks are not required when comparing differential gene expression via RNA Polymerase occupancy.

All external data files are read using `r Biocpkg("rtracklayer")` and can be gzip compressed or uncompressed as required.

## Input data generation

`r Biocpkg('damidBind')` can work with either raw data files or preprocessed data in `r Biocpkg("GenomicRanges")` format.

### BEDGRAPH binding / accessibility profiles

We recommend that [damidseq_pipeline](https://owenjm.github.io/damidseq_pipeline) is used to generate input files:

-   Using default options to generate log2 ratio protein binding BEDGRAPHs
-   Using the `--catada` flag on Dam-only samples to generate count-based CATaDa accesibility BEDGRAPHs

### Peak GFF files

We recommend that [find_peaks](https://github.com/owenjm/find_peaks) is used to generate peak files on each DamID / CATaDa BEDGRAPH file replicate:

-   In all cases, the default options of `--min_quant=0.8 --unified_peaks=min` are recommended

# Using damidBind

Load the library

```{r load_library}
library(damidBind)
```

## Loading data

A small example dataset is provided with `r Biocpkg('damidBind')`. The dataset is derived from the binding of Bsh in L4 and L5 neurons of the *Drosophila melanogaster* lamina [@Xu2024], truncated to chromosome 2L. The raw data was processed using `damidseq_pipeline` and peaks called using `find_peaks` (see the publication Methods for more details).

To load up the data, we only need to know the path to the installed example datafiles:

```{r data_files}
data_dir <- system.file("extdata", package = "damidBind")

# Show the files present for clarity in this vignette example:
files <- list.files(data_dir)
print(files)
```

And then we can use `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` on the data. First, we load up the data. There are two potential commands that can be used for data loading, depending on the data being analysed:

`load_data_peaks()`

:   Used to load binding data with associated peaks files (e.g. transcription factor binding, CATaDa accessibility)

`load_data_genes()`

:   Used to load RNA Polymerase occupancy DamID data (as a proxy for gene expression, as per [@Southall2013,@Marshall2015]). For these data, no peak files are required (as occupancy is calculated over the gene bodies).

In this case, we're dealing with the binding of the transcription factor Bsh, so we'll use the `load_data_peaks()`. As this is the same transcription factor being profiled in two different cell types, and we'd expect the binding distribution to be similar, we'll use quantile normalisation on the datasets.

```{r load_data}
input.bsh <- load_data_peaks(
    binding_profiles_path = data_dir,
    peaks_path = data_dir,
    quantile_norm = TRUE
)
```

## Analysing differential binding

Now, we'll determine the differential binding of Bsh between L4 and L5 neurons. Our input files use `L4` and `L5` labels to distinguish the samples, and that's all we need to know here.

Again, there are two different analysis options depending on the data type:

`differential_binding()`

:   Analyses conventional DamID data (including RNA Polymerase DamID) present as a log2(Dam-fusion/Dam-only) ratio. All standard DamID data is in this format.  `r Biocpkg("limma")` is used as the backend for analysis. 

`differential_accessibility()`

:   Analyses CATaDa data (Dam-only chromatin accessibility data) present as Counts Per Million reads (CPM) or raw counts. Only CATaDa data (generated via e.g. `damidseq_pipeline --catada`) should be used with this function.  Given the counts nature of these data, `r Biocpkg("NOISeq")` is used as the analysis backend.

The input from `load_data_peaks()` or `load_data_genes()` feeds directly into these functions.

Here, we're not dealing with CATaDa data, so we'll use `differential_binding()` to find the significant, differentially-bound loci between the two conditions:

```{r differential_binding}
diff.bsh <- differential_binding(
    input.bsh,
    cond = c("L4", "L5"),
    cond_names = c("L4 neurons", "L5 neurons")
)
```

Please note the required `cond` parameter to this function, which specifies the filename text that distinguished the two separate conditions to test. `cond[1]` must be a text string present in all, and only all, of the filenames of the **first** condition to test; `cond[2]` must be a text string present in all, and only all, of the filenames of the **second** condition to test.

The use of `cond_names` here is optional, and provides display names for the conditions for downstream visualisation.

Note that when run, `differential_binding` (or `differential_accessibility`) will list the replicates found under each condition. The package attempts to ensure that condition search overlaps are avoided, but please check that all replicates have been correctly assigned.

The functions' output provides a quick "top ten" list of genes associated with the most significant, differentially bound loci. This is provided for a quick verification that the analysis was worked correctly, and does not imply any special value to the listed genes beyond that. 

Both `differential_binding()` and `differential_accessibility()` return a `DamIDResults` S4 object, that forms the basis of downstream analysis.  Printing the object will provide a simple summary of the analysis results.

```{r show_object}
# See a summary of the results object
diff.bsh
```

To fully explore the differentially bound loci, use one of the visualisation functions below.  


## Visualising data

All downstream visualisation / data exploration functions take the `DamIDResults` object returned from the analysis functions `differential_binding()` or `differential_accessibility()`.

### Venn diagrams of differentially bound loci

Venn diagrams are a simple means of visualising the proportion of loci that are differentially bound between the two tested conditions.  To provide this, `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` uses `r CRANpkg("BioVenn")` to generate proportional Venn diagrams of the two conditions.  The set union represents significant binding peaks that fail to show significant differences in occupancy; the exclusive regions of each set represent regions with enriched differential binding in that condition.

```{r venn, fig.cap="A venn diagram of significantly bound loci by Bsh in L4 and L5 neurons.  The exclusive parts of each set represent regions that are differentially bound between the two conditions.", fig.small=TRUE, message=FALSE}
plot_venn(diff.bsh)
```

### Volcano plots

`r Biocpkg('damidBind')` comes with a comprehensive volcano plot function. The following gives some idea as to the capabilities.

#### The default volcano plot

The simple volcano plot already gives a clear picture of differentially bound loci and their associated genes.

```{r volcanoPlotSimple, fig.cap="Differential binding of Bsh in L4 and L5 neuronal subtypes.  Genes associated with differentially bound peaks are displayed; the limitations of label overlaps means that only outliers are labelled.  (Dataset from chromosome 2L only)"}
plot_volcano(
    diff.bsh
)
```

#### Cleaning up the gene names

However, a lot of plot label space can be taken up by generally uninformative snoRNA / tRNA genes. We can optionally remove these from the plot using the `clean_names=TRUE` parameter, to show more potentially informative labels.

```{r volcanoPlotCleanNames, fig.cap="Differential binding of Bsh in L4 and L5 neuronal subtypes.  Genes associated with differentially bound peaks are displayed, after some common, but less useful, gene label classes are removed.  (Dataset from chromosome 2L only)"}
plot_volcano(
    diff.bsh,
    label_config = list(clean_names = TRUE)
)
```

Already, that's becoming a lot clearer. 

#### Highlighting gene groups

But, what if we now wanted to highlight genes bound by Bsh, that are only expressed in L4 neurons? (data from scRNA-seq data, provided in Supplementary Files 2 & 3 of [@Xu2024]). This is straightforward to do:

```{r volcanoPlotHighlightedGenes, fig.cap="Differential binding of Bsh in L4 and L5 neuronal subtypes.  Genes that are specifically expressed in L4 neurons are highlighted.  (Dataset from chromosome 2L only)"}
L4_only_genes <- c("Mp", "tnc", "grn", "rut", "mtd", "rdgB", "Octbeta2R", "msi", "Octbeta3R", "beat-IIIb", "ap", "Fili", "LRP1", "CG7378", "CG13698", "twit", "CG9336", "tok", "CG12991", "dpr1", "CG42339", "beat-IIb", "mav", "CG34377", "alpha-Man-IIb", "Pli", "CG32428", "osp", "Pka-R2", "CG15202", "CG8916", "CG15894", "side", "CG42258", "CHES-1-like", "SP2353", "CG44838", "Atg1", "Traf4", "DIP-beta", "KCNQ", "metro", "nAChRalpha1", "path", "CG10527", "Pde8", "CG30116", "CG7985", "CG1688", "dpr12", "pigs", "Eip63F-1", "CG14795", "2mit", "CG42340", "BicD", "CG18265", "hppy", "5-HT1A", "Chd64", "CG33090", "Dyb", "Btk29A", "Apc", "Rox8", "nAChRalpha5", "CG42748", "CG3257", "CG2269", "beat-IV", "CG8086", "glec", "CG31688", "oaf", "Drl-2", "CG8188", "aos", "CG31676", "REPTOR", "RabX4", "alt", "Pura", "DIP1", "ewg", "side-VIII", "nAChRalpha7", "Alh", "kug", "Ca-Ma2d", "bru2", "CG43737", "lncRNA:CR44024", "lncRNA:CR46006", "Had1", "CG3961", "comm", "Toll-6", "CG13685", "tow", "CG10019")

plot_volcano(
    diff.bsh,
    label_config = NULL,
    highlight = list(
        "L4 specific" = L4_only_genes
    ),
    highlight_config = list(
        size = 1.5,
        label = TRUE
    )
)
```

Although this is just a truncated sample from chr 2L, the link between a subset of Bsh binding and potential upregulation in this lineage is apparent.

We could also compare this against genes bound by Bsh and only expressed in L5 neurons. For clarity, we'll drop gene labels from this plot.

```{r volcannoPlotMultipleHighlights, fig.cap="Differential binding of Bsh in L4 and L5 neuronal subtypes.  Genes that are specifically expressed in each subtype are highlighted.   (Dataset from chromosome 2L only)"}
L5_only_genes <- c("Ptth", "Nep2", "kek1", "CG4168", "kek3", "CG6959", "Dtg", "ND-23", "Scp2", "Octalpha2R", "Hs6st", "CG16791", "SKIP", "LpR1", "RpL34a", "Ald1", "CG10011", "heph", "nolo", "Act42A", "Fkbp12", "Pkc53E", "AstC-R1", "Muc14A", "CG33543", "ChAT", "Act5C", "Ptpmeg2", "fabp", "CG31221", "Octbeta1R", "CG14669", "sdk", "Shawl", "side-V", "NaCP60E", "sif", "OtopLc", "side-II", "kuz", "CG42540", "Dscam3", "haf", "CG42673", "pdm3", "tinc", "CG42750", "sdt", "Nuak1", "Hk", "scrib", "tsr", "dpr20", "GluRIB", "CG43902", "CG44242", "Dscam2", "CG44422", "lncRNA:CR45312", "Scsalpha1", "Rop", "Con", "Hsc70-3", "dpr8", "eag", "ND-18", "Nrt", "CG17839", "fz", "CG32137", "Rh7", "Sod1", "CG32052", "dpr6", "Hsp67Ba", "axed", "GluRIA", "robo2")


plot_volcano(
    diff.bsh,
    label_config = NULL,
    highlight = list(
        "L4 specific" = L4_only_genes,
        "L5 specific" = L5_only_genes
    ),
    highlight_config = list(
        size = 1.5,
        label = FALSE
    )
)
```

Here, the L5-specific Bsh peaks show no clear link with upregulated or downregulated genes between the lineages.

### Browsing differentially-bound regions with an igvShiny browser window

A volcano plot, while useful, still does not put the binding data into a genomic context. For this `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` provides an interactive Shiny browser window (via `r CRANpkg("Shiny")` and `r Biocpkg("igvShiny")`), where an interactive table of enriched loci allows quick exploration of these in the genome browser.

```{r igv_shiny}
## Interactive, blocking session, uncomment to run
# browse_igv_regions(diff.bsh)
```

An example of the interface is shown below:

![The interactive IGV browser window of damidBind](figures/damidBind_L5.png)

The table on the left side of the window can be sorted by clicking on the column headers, and clicking on any entry will move the IGV browser window to that locus (+/- a sensible buffer region).  All sample reps are shown, together with the unified binding peaks and a simple pair of tracks that show the loci that are enriched in both conditions.

### GSEA plots

Gene ontology is a powerful means of understanding which biological processes may be changing between two sets of data. Using `r Biocpkg("clusterProfiler")` as the backend, `r Biocpkg('damidBind')` provides the function `analyse_go_enrichment()` to explore enrichment of genes associated with bound peaks, accessible regions, or differential expression. In all cases, the underlying gene IDs, rather than gene names, are used for enrichment analysis.

```{r gsea, fig.cap="Enriched GO terms for genes associated with differential Bsh binding in L4 neuron.  Dataset from chromosome 2L only."}
go.bsh_l4 <- analyse_go_enrichment(
    diff.bsh,
    direction = "L4",
    org_db = org.Dm.eg.db::org.Dm.eg.db
)
```

The return value of this function includes the full analysis table, including the names of all enriched loci within an ontology term.

## Further analysis

The `DamIDResults` object returned by `differential_binding()` and `differential_accessibility()` contains a slot named `analysis` (a dataframe) that can be used for any additional downstream data exploration, filtering, or analysis. You access this slot using the `analysisTable()` accessor.

Below are the first 20 lines of `analysisTable(diff.bsh)` to illustrate the structure.

```{r paged_table, echo=FALSE, results='asis'}
# Display the data frame as a paged table
DT::datatable(
    head(analysisTable(diff.bsh), n = 20),
    options = list(
        pageLength = 10, 
        scrollX = TRUE
    )
) %>% DT::formatRound(columns = c(1:8, 11), digits = 2)
```
