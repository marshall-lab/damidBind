\arguments{
\item{binding_profiles_path}{Character vector of directories or file globs
containing log2 ratio binding tracks in bedGraph format. Wildcards ('*') supported.}

\item{binding_profiles}{Named list of GRanges objects representing binding profiles.}

\item{quantile_norm}{Logical (default: FALSE) quantile-normalise across all signal columns if TRUE.}

\item{organism}{Organism string (lower case) to obtain genome annotation from (if not providing a custom `ensdb_genes` object)
Defautls to "drosophila melanogaster".}

\item{calculate_fdr}{Calculate FDR based on RNA Pol occupancy (see details) (default: FALSE)}

\item{fdr_iterations}{Number of iterations to use to determine null model for FDR (default: 50000)}

\item{ensdb_genes}{GRanges object: gene annotation. Automatically obtained from `organism` if NULL.}

\item{BPPARAM}{BiocParallel function (defaults to BiocParallel::bpparam())}
}
\value{
List with elements:
  \item{binding_profiles_data}{data.frame of merged binding profiles, with chr, start, end, sample columns.}
  \item{occupancy}{data.frame of occupancy values summarised over genes.}
  \item{test_category}{Character scalar; will be "expressed".}
}
\description{
Reads RNA Polymerase DamID binding profiles either from bedGraph files or
directly from a named list of GRanges objects. Calculates binding occupancy
summarised over genes.
}
\details{
One of `binding_profiles_path` or `binding_profiles` must be provided.

When supplying GRanges lists, each GRanges should contain exactly one numeric
metadata column representing the signal, and `binding_profiles` must be a
named list, with element names used as sample names.


The algorithm for determining gene occupancy FDR (as a proxy for gene expression)
is based on `polii.gene.call`, which in turn was based on that described in
Southall et al. (2013). Dev Cell, 26(1), 101–12. doi:10.1016/j.devcel.2013.05.020.
Briefly, the algorithm establishes a null model by simulating the distribution of mean occupancy scores
from random fragments.  It fits a two-tiered regression to predict the False Discovery Rate (FDR), based
on fragment count and score. For each gene, the true weighted mean occupancy and fragment count are
calculated from the provided binding profile. Finally, the pre-computed regression models are used
to assign a specific FDR to each gene based on its observed occupancy and fragment count.
