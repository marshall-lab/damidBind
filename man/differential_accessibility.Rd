\title{Differential Accessibility Analysis for CATaDa (NOISeq based)}
\usage{
differential_accessibility(
  data_list,
  cond,
  cond_names = NULL,
  norm = "n",
  q = 0.8
)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_list}{List. Output from load_data.peaks.}

\item{cond}{Vector (character). Two strings identifying the two conditions to compare.
The order matters: `cond[1]` is used as Condition 1, `cond[2]` as Condition 2.}

\item{cond_names}{Vector (character, optional). Custom display names for
the two conditions in outputs/plots. Order maps to `cond`.}

\item{norm}{Normalisation method passed to NOISeq.  Defaults to "n" (no normalisation), but "uqua"
(upper quantile) or "tmm" (trimmed mean of M) are options if needed}

\item{q}{Numeric. Q-value threshold for NOISeq significance (default 0.8).}
}
\value{
A `DamIDResults` object containing the results. Access slots using the `@`
  accessor (e.g., `results@analysis`). The object includes:
  \item{upCond1}{data.frame of regions enriched in condition 1}
  \item{upCond2}{data.frame of regions enriched in condition 2}
  \item{analysis}{data.frame of full results for all tested regions}
  \item{cond}{A named character vector mapping display names to internal condition names}
  \item{data}{The original `data_list` input}
}
\description{
Setup and differential analysis for CATaDa chromatin accessibility experiments using NOISeq.
Accepts output from load_data.peaks, prepares count matrix,
performs NOISeq analysis, and returns differentially-accessible loci.
}
