\arguments{
\item{diff_results}{A `DamIDResults` object, as returned by
`differential_binding()` or `differential_accessibility()`.}

\item{samples}{Optional character vector of sample names to display (default: all in dataset).}

\item{colour_cond1, colour_cond2}{Colours for differentially enriched region tracks.}

\item{use_genome}{IGV genome name (inferred from peak annotations if not given).}

\item{padding_width}{Width to pad browser viewbox on either side of the peak}

\item{host}{Hostname for the server location (defaults to localhost)}

\item{port}{Port for connection (if NULL (default) the port is assigned by Shiny)}
}
\value{
(Invisibly) launches a Shiny app in the user's browser.
}
\description{
Launches a Shiny app with an embedded IGV browser and an interactive table listing
differentially-bound regions (from `differential_binding()` or `differential_acccessibility()` results).
Clicking on a region in the table will pan IGV to that locus. Sample coverage and region tracks are loaded as quantitative/annotation tracks.
