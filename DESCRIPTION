Description: 
    Identifies differentially-bound loci and/or differentially-expressed genes 
    from DamID-seq datasets. Provides flexible quantification, visualisation 
    (IGV visualisation, volcano, GSEA and Venn plots), built around 
    a limma/NOIseq framework and standard Bioconductor classes.
