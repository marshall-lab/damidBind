Description: Identifies differentially-bound loci and/or differentially-expressed genes 
    from DamID-seq datasets. Provides flexible quantification, visualisation 
    (IGV visualisation, volcano plots and Venn plots), and statistical enrichment 
    utilities, built around a limma/NOIseq framework and standard Bioconductor classes.
